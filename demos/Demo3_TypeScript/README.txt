# AutoSave-Prime: Typescript Demo

This is a quickstart for getting up and running using the type definitions file bundled with AutoSave-Prime incase you haven't used such files before or just want a pointer to get started quickly.

## Get started

Take a copy of this directory and in this top-level folder, run the following

- Run 'npm install'
- Run the typescript compiler 'tsc' or, if you don't have it globally, 'npm install typescript' then '.\node_modules\.bin\tsc'
- Double click index.html and you should see the AutoSave version showing
- In an IDE like VSCode, open the root folder and go to scripts\run.ts, you'll get strong typing due to the definition file located at autosave-prime/dist/AutoSave.d.ts
